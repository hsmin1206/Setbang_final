# Spring MVC2 Team Project
**SETbang 🏢 / Shared Office Support System**

[![Video Label](http://img.youtube.com/vi/iOZ7OaQsLnA/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/iOZ7OaQsLnA)

## 💻 Introduction
* Increased demand for shared office due to increased demand for single-person & small-scale business start-ups.
* The current shared office in Korea lacks user convenience when using services, and the services are not diverse.
* For that reason we developed a shared office support website that enhances user convenience and as well as business connection when using the services.
